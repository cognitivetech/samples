- ## Icelandic Sagas

    As I see it, there are three broad reasons a work might end up on a list of "great books." The first is that the work is a vehicle for immense beauty or stunning insight. This is necessarily subjective. My decision to include the [Icelandic Sagas](https://amzn.to/31NgEa2) instead of the _[Nibelungenlied](https://amzn.to/31LpYvc)_ was made on these grounds. Both show the West's Germanic heritage; both provide a picture of less-than-heaven-centered Medieval minds at work. But at the end of _my_ day, the emotional journey _[Njal's Saga](https://amzn.to/32P1gLw)_ and its kin took _me_ on was filled with terrible meaning. The _Nibelungenlied_ I just found terribly interesting.
