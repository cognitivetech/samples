# American Gun Culture 
## **Caroline E. Light and Lindsay Livingston | [(Source)](https://www.publicbooks.org/gun-studies-syllabus/)**

*In the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting of February 14, 2018, scholar Danielle McGuire invited historians on Twitter to propose readings that would provide resources for gun control activists. In response, Public Books reached out to scholars Caroline Light and Lindsay Livingston to develop a Gun Studies Syllabus.*

There are an estimated 310 million firearms in the United States today—more than one gun per person—and while the US comprises about 5 percent of the world’s population, its inhabitants possess over 40 percent of the world’s guns. The US also experiences more gun deaths than any economically comparable nation: more than 38,600 in 2016, with nearly two-thirds of them suicides. How did the nation get here, and what is it doing to prevent gun violence? To answer these questions, this syllabus provides an interdisciplinary introduction to America’s unique “gun culture.”


- ## “To Keep and Bear”: An Introduction to Gun Culture in the United States

    This section's readings seek to demystify and question what is meant by “gun culture” and to introduce some popular databases by which gun ownership and gun violence have been tracked and studied in the contemporary US.

    How was the West “won,” and what kinds of violence do our nation’s “Wild West” mythologies obfuscate or silence? This week’s readings unpack and critique traditional notions of the heroic armed “cowboy” whose pluck and determination supposedly tamed a “wild” frontier.

- ## “This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed”: Civil Rights and Armed Resistance

    Although today historians tend to celebrate the Civil Rights Movement as an example of nonviolent resistance, in the 1960s and 1970s many activists advocated armed self-reliance to oppose white supremacist violence. This week’s readings illuminate what happened when African Americans mobilized their Second Amendment rights to defend communal safety and claim the privileges and protections of full citizenship.
